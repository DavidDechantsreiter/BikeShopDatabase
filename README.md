# BikeShopDatabase
This project is a database for a bikeshop. I first created an entity relationship diagram to map out the relations between datasets. Next, I hosted the database on PostgreSQL and used DataGrip to interact with the database. Finally, I coded a python script to automatically populate the tables and a basic search engine to interact with the database.
